        <strong>Hawai'i's Housing Crisis Post-Pandemic:</strong><br>
        This map illustrates the distribution of Airbnb listings across Hawai’i as of October 2024. 
       After the COVID-19 pandemic, Hawai'i’s housing market experienced a sharp rebound, with demand for both homes and short-term rentals surging. The increase in tourism, combined with an influx of corporate investment in real estate, intensified the housing crisis, making it harder for locals to find affordable long-term housing. Short-term rentals, especially those listed on platforms like Airbnb, have played a significant role in this crisis by taking much-needed properties off the market and driving up rental prices. As more homes are converted into vacation rentals, fewer are available for residents, displacing local families and pushing up costs. This map illustrates the growing presence of short-term rentals across Hawai'i, highlighting their role in exacerbating the shortage of affordable housing for local communities.
